# **Use Case: Chatbot for UNEJ Student Service**
SIUBOT (Simple UNEJ BOT) is a chatbot designed to assist the academic community and the public in accessing information available on the official website of the University of Jember. This chatbot gathers data through web scraping from the university's official website and is built using the Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model from Groq.

With a Gradio-based visualization, SIUBOT serves as a simple prototype of a university chatbot, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in obtaining official university information.

## **Limitations**  
This simple chatbot has several limitations, including:  
1. The chatbot only provides answers based on the information available on the official University of Jember website.  
2. It can only respond to questions in **Indonesian**.  

## **Development Suggestions**  
Future improvements may include using a more advanced language model or chatbot architecture to enhance response accuracy. Implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** could improve inference by incorporating internal data for more relevant answers. Additionally, expanding multilingual support would allow the chatbot to respond in multiple languages based on user preferences. Further enhancements could also include a more comprehensive **user interface** for a better user experience. 

The **SIUBOT** model is currently under development to become more **flexible and adaptive**. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
